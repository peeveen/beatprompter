[DRUMS]
[C][Dm][G]

{bpl:1}[C]I couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what
[Em]everybody needs
[Am]I shouldn't let you kick me when I'm
[Em]down, my [Dm]ba[G7]by
[F/C]I find out everybody knows that
[G/B]You've been using [G]me
[Dm7]I'm surprised you
[G]Let me stay around you

[C]One day I'm gonna lift the cover
And [Em]look inside your heart
[Am]We gotta level before we go
And [Fm7]tear this love apart

There's no [C]fight you can't fight<
This [F]battle of [G]love with [C]me, you win again
[Am]So little time<
We do [Dm7]nothing but com[G]pete<
There's no [C]life on earth<
No [F]other could [G]see me [C]through, you win again
[Am]Some never try<
But if [Dm7]anybody can, we [Gsus2]can
{bpb:6}[G]And [Gsus4]I'll be, I'll be<
{bpb:4}Following [C]you<

[A#]Ah [F]girl
,,,[C][A#]Oh [F]baby, Iâ€™ll shake you from now [Em]on<
{bpl:2}I'm gonna [Am]break down your defences one by [Em]one
,I'm gonna [Am]hit you from all sides<
,Lay your [D7]fortress open wide
[G7]Nobody stops [F]this body from [Em7]taking [G7/D]you<

{bpl:1}You better be[C]ware, I swear, I'm gonna be there
[Em]one day when you fall
[Am]I could never let you cast aside
The [Fm7]greatest love of all

There's no [C]fight you can't fight<
This [F]battle of [G]love with [C]me, you win again
[Am]So little time<
We do [Dm7]nothing but com[G]pete<
There's no [C]life on earth<
No [F]other could [G]see me [C]through, you win again

{bpb:6}[G]And [Gsus4]I'll be, I'll be<
