{t:002-BarsAndCommasSameLine}
{c:Commas should take precedence}
{bpl:4}{bpm:120}

This is four bars per line,
,This has one comma, so is one line
{bpl:2},This is two bars per line, with a one-bar comma after the bpl
This, with no commas, should now be two bars
,,{bpl:4}This is four bars per line, with two commas BEFORE the bpl ... should still be two bars
This, with no commas, should now be four bars
And weâ€™re done (four bars here).
