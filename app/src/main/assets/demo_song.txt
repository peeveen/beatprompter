[G]BeatPrompter is an app that displays
lyrics and [Em]chords in time with a beat.
[C]It never goes too fast or slow,
[D]So it can display the text really big!
[C]We're currently in [D]standard 4/4 time
[G]with one line every two bars.
,,,,[Em]But watch: this [C]line last for [D]four bars!
[G]The bar along the top of the screen
[Em]shows the beat progression.
[C]The little marker [D]at the end
[G]shows when the display will scroll.
[Em]Sometimes a line scrolls a bit sooner
[C]Like this [D]one!<<
[G]And sometimes there's a pause in a song
{pause:5}like [D]this one right here!
{bpm:130}[G]And now the speed has changed.
[G]But BeatPrompter can cope with that.
[Em]It can play backing tracks too
[C]and it also has MIDI functionality.
[D]Check the documentation for full details.

[Em]I hope you like it!
