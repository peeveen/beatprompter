# BeatPrompter Documentation

**BeatPrompter** is a time-sensitive visual prompter app for song lyrics and/or chords which places a greater emphasis on visibility, timing and rhythm than other similar apps. By defining such things as beats-per-minute, beats-per-bar, bars-per-line, etc, you can have a greater control over the display, and by knowing that the on-screen text will definitely be in the right place at the right time, BeatPrompter can display each line of the song in as large a font as possible, making it more readable from a greater distance, or for users with imperfect vision.

BeatPrompter can also be used as a MIDI controller. It can respond to and send out MIDI signals at key moments during a song. See the separate MIDI documentation for full details.

BeatPrompter reads song files that have been created in the popular ChordPro format, with several custom additions.

## Usage

Before using the BeatPrompter app, you will probably need to do a few things.

1. You cannot use BeatPrompter without some song files to play, so before going any further, you should get some, or create some. They can be created with any text editor. If you want some demo files to play with, try [here](https://github.com/peeveen/beatprompter-demo-files).

2. If you are coming to BeatPrompter with an existing library of ChordPro song files, then you will probably want to update those files with some BeatPrompter-specific tags. To see the full list of tags that BeatPrompter can use, see [Supported Song File Tags]().

3. Make your song files available to the app. BeatPrompter currently reads files from the popular (and free) [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and [Microsoft OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-gb/) cloud storage services, so your files can be stored in one of these (Google Drive is recommended for the excellent editing facilities). You can also store your song files directly in your device storage. For instructions about synchronizing the content, see Files.

## Song List

When you first load the app, the song list will contain only the demo song. You will need to tell BeatPrompter where your song files are stored (see [Files]() for details about synchronizing BeatPrompter with your cloud storage).

Once you have some songs, the list will look something like this (shown here in light mode, though the app also has a dark mode) ...

![Song List](../media/songList.png)

1. Bluetooth connectivity indicator. This icon will not be shown if you are not using Bluetooth functionality. Also, it will look different depending on whether you are the band leader or not, and whether or not you are connected.
2. This is the song and set list filter. If your songs contain any {tag} fields that specify grouping tags (see the {tag} documentation in [Supported Song File Tags]()), then this will be populated with those values, allowing you to filter the list accordingly. Or if your songs exist in subfolders, the folder names will be listed here. Also, any setlists you have created will be listed here (see Setlists).
3. This button allows you to perform a simple text search of the current list of songs.
4. This is the main app menu. From here you can adjust preferences, synchronize your files, or sort the song list according to various criteria.
5. This is the main list of songs.
6. A drum icon next to a song means that it can be played in “beat mode”, i.e. the song file has timing information encoded into it, such as beats-per-minute, etc.
7. A document icon next to a song means that it can be played in “smooth mode”, where the song just scrolls automatically at a fixed speed.
8. It is possible for a song to use no scrolling modes (if it does not contain a {bpm} or {time} tag). Such songs can be displayed by BeatPrompter, but will not scroll automatically (“manual mode”).
9. A music-note icon indicates that a song is associated with an audio file, which will be used as a backing track when playing the song.
10. If a song supports multiple scrolling modes, it will use beat-scrolling by default, but you can choose what mode to use with a long-press on the song to display the advanced options menu.

## Playing A Song

To play a song, simply tap on the song in the list. If your song can be played in multiple scroll modes, or has multiple backing tracks that you can choose from, a long press on the song will display the advanced song options menu, and choosing “Play ...” will allow you to choose the variation, transpose amount, scrolling mode and no-audio options.

![Song Options](../media/songOptions.png) ![Play Options](../media/playOptions.png)

Once you select a song to play, you will first see this screen which shows you the song title, artist, the content of any `{comment}/{c}` tags from the song file, and any errors (with line numbers) that BeatPrompter has encountered while interpreting the song file.

![Song Intro Screen](../media/songIntroScreen.png)

In this case, the song file has two errors.

- The `{count}` tag has been specified twice on line 3, which makes no sense.
- Also, on line 12, the `scrollbeat` offset has been moved to beyond the end of the following line or before the start of the current line, neither of which are permitted.

However, all being well, you are asked to tap the screen twice to start the song. The first tap will take you to the actual song display screen, and the second tap will start it moving.

> It should be noted that, at this point, the screen orientation is locked. If you want to change orientation, you will have to go back to the song list screen first.

## Song Display Screen

![Song Display](../media/songDisplay.png)

- The lyric at the top of the display is what you should currently be playing/singing.
- In beat scrolling mode, the bar along the top of the display shows what beat the song is currently on, and the small white marker shows on which beat the display will scroll to the next line. Additionally, the entire background will gently pulse in time to the beat, though this can be disabled.
- For each line in the song, BeatPrompter will try to fit it on the screen horizontally, using as large a font as possible. Note that you can control the minimum and maximum font size that BeatPrompter will use in the preferences menu. See [Settings - Song Display]() for details.
- If a line is very long, or if the minimum font size means that the line cannot fit the screen, BeatPrompter will break it over multiple lines.
- Tapping the screen will pause/resume the song, and you can also scroll around the song using normal scrolling techniques. The song will automatically pause once you start scrolling. If you have a backing track, the track will stop while you are scrolling, and resume playing at the correct point when the song is started again. You can prevent accidental pausing/scrolling during performance by using one of the preference settings.
- All colors (background, background pulse color, lyrics, chords, beat indicator, current-line highlight, etc) can be customized in the preferences menu.
- Note that BeatPrompter will not display blank lines. If your song file contains lines with no lyrics or chords, they will not be displayed, though any tags contained on that line will still be processed. The only exception is if you have a “blank” line that starts with commas (bar markers) ... in this case BeatPrompter will insert a ▼ blank-line marker into the song display.

##Song Files

A song file is a plain text file that contains additional encoded information about the song. Here is a short example of a song file:

```
{title:Happy Birthday}

Happy [D]Birthday to [A]you
Happy birthday to [D]you
Happy [D7]birthday, dear [G]Steven
Happy [D]birthday [A]to [D]you
```

The `{title}` tag contains the name of the song, and the rest of the file is the song lyrics with the chords that should be played at the appropriate point in the lyrics. For a simple song like this, there’s not much more that you need, but what if you a performing a longer song, perhaps with a backing track, where it is important to keep time with the rhythm, and where you want to guarantee that the words on the screen will never be too far ahead or scrolling too slowly? Well, that’s where BeatPrompter comes in.

BeatPrompter allows you to define the speed of a song, either in beats-per-minute for songs with a distinct rhythm, or in minutes and seconds for more fluid songs. You describe this information to the app by inserting tags into your song files, much like how the title and chords were inserted into the simple example above.

## Supported Song File Tags

Below are the tags and symbols that BeatPrompter interprets from a song file.

In cases where a tag has various synonymous names, all are listed.

So if a song has four beats to the bar, it will scroll on (and not after) the fourth beat.<br/>This is not always suitable, as sometimes the vocals for the next line begin before the last beat has completed. To change the beat on which the line scrolls, use this tag. Note that this change applies from that line onwards.<br/>Because it is fairly common for the scroll beat to vary from line to line, a shorthand way of adjusting the scroll beat is available. If a line ends with a number of > or < characters, then the scroll beat (for that line only) will be increased or decreased by one beat accordingly, e.g:<br/><br/>`{scrollbeat:4}[G]This line will scroll on [A#]the 4th beat`<br/>`But [D]this line will scroll on the second!<<`<br/><br/>Remember that reducing the scrollbeat effectively increases the length of the next line by a number of beats, and vice versa. |

The number should be in seconds, but does not have to be an integer, e.g. {pause:12.5} is allowed. This pause overrides any beat timing for the line on which the pause occurs, so once the pause ends, the display will scroll to the next line.

You can override the Default Track Volume by preceding the volume value with “=”, e.g.:<br/><br/>`{audio:TakeMeAnywhere.mp3:=88}`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

You can define this in minutes and seconds:<br/><br/>`{time:4:26}`<br/><br/>... or just in seconds:<br/><br/>`{time:312.56}`<br/><br/>BeatPrompter will take this time, subtract any `{pause}` time from it, and divide it by the number of bars in the song. The result is how long each bar will take to pass, so a line that spans one bar will take that amount of time to scroll offscreen, a line that spans two bars will take twice that time, etc.<br/><br/>You can also tell BeatPrompter to use the length of the backing track as the time value with the special `track` token, like this:<br/><br/>`{time:track}`<br/><br/>If you use this token, and then play the song with no backing track (using the advanced options menu), the time will be the length of the first backing track defined in the song file.                                                   |

Most common image formats are accepted. This allows you to simply scan in pages and use the BeatPrompter scrolling facilities to display them. Alternatively, you could insert small sections of handwritten tabs, etc, into normal text displays. Only one image tag is allowed per line. The file specified in the tag must exist in your cloud storage alongside the file that references it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `{comment:abcd}` `{c:abcd}` `{comment@User:abcd}` `{c@User:abcd}` `{comment@User:abcd###XXXXXX}` `{c@User:abcd###XXXXXX}` | Defines a comment. Note that comments defined _before_ the first line of the song will be displayed on the title screen, while comments defined _after_ the first line will be displayed as popup messages at the foot of the screen while the song is running. You can specify the audience for a comment using the @ symbol. This functionality operates in conjunction with the “Custom Comments User” preference. This prevents a user seeing a comment that isn’t intended for them. For example, only a guitarist would need to know the capo setting for a song, so you could put `{c@Guitarist:Capo 3}`, and only the user who has specified “Guitarist” as their custom comment name would see it. You can also specify multiple names/roles within one comment, e.g. `{c@Bass@BackingVocals:blah}`. You can specify a color (using an extra “###” delimiter as shown). Be aware that comments shown on the song intro screen are always drawn against a black background.                                                         |

The non-beat sections will not scroll automatically: you will need to use some kind of manual scrolling mechanism until the next beat section is reached (e.g. Bluetooth pedal)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It will only appear in set lists, tag lists, or subfolder lists. This is generally best used for “special occasion” songs that you don’t want to see in your list all the time (e.g. Christmas songs, etc). As well as using this tag in specific song files, you can create a file (any size) called `.filter_only` in a folder, and all songs in that folder will be treated as if they have the `{filter_only}` tag.

## Files

BeatPrompter reads files from various different storage systems. The currently supported systems are:

- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Microsoft OneDrive
- Local device storage

Before it can download your data, you must tell BeatPrompter where your data is stored.

1. Go to the `Settings` > `Files` page.
2. Select `Storage System`. You will be prompted to choose which of the available systems you want to use.
3. Select `Storage Folder`.
   - If this is the first time you have done this, you might see one or more security prompts asking you to verify that you want to allow BeatPrompter to access your storage. You have to agree to this in order to use BeatPrompter.
   - Depending on what storage system you are using, you may also see a prompt asking you to choose a user account. You should respond appropriately.
4. If BeatPrompter successfully connects to your storage, then all being well, you should see a folder browser. Browse to the location where your files are stored and press OK.
5. BeatPrompter can now download your data. From the main app menu, select `Synchronize Files` from the menu. The amount of time that this process takes will depend on the type of storage that you are using, and the volume of data and the speed of the connection.

> **Note that, if using Google Drive, your song files don’t have to be stored as .txt, or .chopro, or any particular text format.** Any format that can be interpreted as text can be used, including the Google Docs format. This format is particularly useful, as you can create and edit these files directly in the Google Drive app. Also, if you find the `{tags}` and annotations annoying when you are simply sight-reading your files, you can reduce their size to near-zero, or change their color to white/near-white so that they are largely invisible: BeatPrompter will still see them!

> In Dropbox and OneDrive, your song files must be plain text (.txt) files.

Once all the data has been downloaded, the BeatPrompter app will scan the downloaded files and present you with a list of usable songs. Note that song files that do not contain a title (specified with `{title}` or `{t}`) will not be listed.

## Single File Refresh

If you make a change to a file, then there is a simple way to update that one song, rather than doing a full synchronization. Long-press the song in the song list, and you will see this menu:

![Song Options](../media/songOptions.png)

Choosing “Force refresh (song file only)” will re-download the song file from the cloud storage.

Choosing “Force refresh (including dependencies)” will re-download the song file and any accompanying audio/image files from the cloud storage.

If you are currently displaying a set list, a third option of “Force refresh of set list” will be available, and will re-fetch the current set list file.

> These options are especially useful for Google Drive users, as small modifications to files sometimes take several minutes before they are reflected in the last-modified date of the file, meaning that a normal synchronization does not see the file as having changed.

## Editing Files

If the currently-selected storage system supports editing files, you will see one or more “edit” options on the long-press menu. Selecting these will launch a cloud-specific text editor, allowing you to make changes. Note that, by doing this, you are editing the remote cloud version of the file, and will still have to refresh/sync your file to see any changes in BeatPrompter.

> Making lengthy edits on a mobile device is not really recommended! This function is really just included for making small corrections to existing files.

## Settings

BeatPrompter has an extensive set of preferences which allow you to customize the app to suit your needs. You can access the preference settings from the main app menu, by simply selecting “Settings”. Here are full descriptions of each preference section, and the preferences contained within.
